-- The Fortran compiler identification is unknown
CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:2 (project):

  Tell CMake where to find the compiler by setting either the environment
  variable "FC" or the CMake cache entry CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER to the full
  path to the compiler, or to the compiler name if it is in the PATH.
